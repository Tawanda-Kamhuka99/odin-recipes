Building a basic recipe website!
The basic website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
Building the basic website will require knowledge on the standard HTML Boilerplate, text & image elements and file directory referencing. 
As it is the first project, there will be no CSS elements. Only HTML. 
CSS elements will be added at a later stage.
